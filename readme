My Service:
I specialize in a BET365 automated betting bot project. 
My service involves managing BET365 accounts provided by my clients. Here's how it works:

Account Setup: 
Clients send me their BET365 accounts with a starting balance of 300-500 EUR.
Profit Sharing: When the account reaches its limit, we split the profit. I take 33% of the profit only.
Monitor Your Account: If you have an active account with our service, you can easily check it at any time using our Telegram bot. The bot provides detailed screenshots of your account, showing your bets and current balance.

Account Restrictions: 
I am currently cannot accept accounts from Italy and Germany due to specific restrictions and bugs related to these regions.

Bot Details:
Platform: BET365 only (Other bookmakers do not support the required leagues).
Bet Types: Primarily live tips, with recent expansions into pre-match bets.
Algorithm: My bot uses a sophisticated algorithm that analyzes historical match data. When certain criteria are met, it identifies valuable betting opportunities in live matches.
Expected Results: Accounts usually start with 300-500 EUR and typically get limited at around 1000-2000 EUR within two weeks, achieving an average of 15% expected value (EV) per bet.
